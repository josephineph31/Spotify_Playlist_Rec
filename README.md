Hi ^.^

This is our final project for the Economic Data Workshop at Keio University, Spring 2025.

From the Spotify_1Millions_Track dataset on Kaggle, we conducted feature selection and feature engineering, then trained a K-means model to cluster all songs into 6 vibes.

To further validate the quality and separation of all clusters, we also made use of CatBoost Classifier (Multi-class) in this project.

As the final step, we built and deployed a simple demo app by using Streamlit. You can get access to our Spotify Playlist Recommendation App here: https://spotifyplaylistreckeio2025.streamlit.app/
